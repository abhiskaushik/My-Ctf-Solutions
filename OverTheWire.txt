-->Dashed files are opened using ./ opertaor beacuse kernel doesn't recognise them as

2-3:

3-4:
-->I used find command to list out hidden files.
4-5:

This finds a file in folder and subfolders whose size is 1033 bytes.
6-7:
--> find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>&1 | grep -v -F Permission
